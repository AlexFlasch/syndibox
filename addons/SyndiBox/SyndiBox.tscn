alright we good
[C:]...
That's Sudo, the programmer. She made us.
[`4][^v]I want to scalp her.[^r][`r][C!]Anyway! Welcome to the SyndiBox text engine demo!
[M:]This demo will show you all the features of SyndiBox as it stands today.
[Z:]Arf![^r] [t5][`7](If you have any suggestions or improvements, please let us know!)[`r]
[m:]But for now, lets go over the features of the text engine.
[C:]All features can be invoked by using brakets ([]).
The first feature we'll demonstrate is [`2]c[`4]o[`5]l[`6]o[`c]r[`r] effects.
There are a wide array of colors available.
If you are familiar with Minecraft's color choices, [t2]you should be able to find the color you want with relative ease.
[M:]Next, we'll demonstrate [*5]sp[*1]eed[*r] effects.
You can make text move [t5][*1]very fast, [t5][*5]very slow, [t5][*r]or options in between.
[m:]Next is [^t]positional[^r] effects.
Current effects include \"[^t]tipsy[^r]\", \"[^d]drunk[^r]\", and \"[^v]vibrate[^r]\".
[C:]To use color effects, input an [`c]accent[`r] mark (`) before the corresponding letter identifier of your choice.
[M:]For speed effects, your choices are 1-5 preceded by an [`c]asterisk[`r] (*).
[m:]Positional effects use a [`c]caret[`r] (^) before the matching letter identifier.
[Z:]Bark![^r] [t5][`7](Adding your own custom identifiers and modifiers is possible via the [`c]custom[`7].gd script.)[`r]
[S:]Other available tags include text pausing (t, s), text hiding (:, |), alternate fonts (%) and character interjections (!).
(it looks like i put two exclamation points but thats just the font sorry)
[S:][^t][`5]Thank you[`r] for viewing this demo![^r]"
